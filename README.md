# Identity Server 4 with .Net Core 3.1

In this repo youll find different implementations for Identity server and clients.

The branches are in order and each one is based on the previous so you can check what's the difference between them.

## Identity Server 4 Demos

* **Basic Setup:** IDP without UI and a console application as the consuming client.<br />
* **Consuming an API:** how to access an API from the console application sending a JWT token for authentication in a machine to machine authentication flow.
* **Adding UI to the IDP:** how to add UI to our Identity Server; the UI helps us to implement all user-related functionalities like login/logout.
* **Adding an MVC Client:** with this MVC client, we explore a different flow for the authentication where de interaction with the user is needed.
* **Adding external logins:** add external logins like Google and Facebook to perform the authentication process using their platform.
* **Adding a JS client:** implementing Angular client to explore authentication with a Javascript-based framework.
